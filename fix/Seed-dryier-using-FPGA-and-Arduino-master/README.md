# SDPU3

This project consists in a VHDL implementation of a seed dryer. It's a unit 3 project of the Digital Systems course, taught by the teacher Sergio Natan Silva.

The FPGA model used was a Altera Cyclone II [Remember to put here the model]. Also, we used an Arduino Uno R3 Atmega 328p to read data from 2 sensors: temperature and humity sensors. For it, we used SPI comunication between the two systems.
